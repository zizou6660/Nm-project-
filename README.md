# AI-Based Supply Chain Management


![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-completed-yellow)

## 📦 Overview

**AI-Based Supply Chain Management** is a project focused on integrating Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies into traditional supply chain systems. The goal is to enhance forecasting accuracy, automate logistics, and optimize inventory management, ultimately reducing costs and improving decision-making across the supply chain.

This project explores and implements intelligent solutions to common supply chain challenges, such as demand prediction, route optimization, and real-time tracking, using modern AI frameworks and tools.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 **Demand Forecasting** – ML-powered models to predict future product demand using historical data and external factors.
- 🚚 **Logistics Optimization** – Route planning and delivery scheduling using AI algorithms.
- 📦 **Inventory Management** – Smart stock level monitoring and restocking alerts.
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Interactive dashboards for KPI tracking and insights.
- 🤖 **Automation** – AI-driven decision-making for supply chain operations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Web Framework**: Flask or Django (for deploying APIs)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite
- **Deployment**: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
